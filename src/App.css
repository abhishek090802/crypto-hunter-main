/* ChatGPT
This code appears to be CSS code that sets some global styles for a web page. Let's go through it step by step to understand its functionality: */

@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@300;400;800&display=swap");
/* @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@300;400;800&display=swap");: This line imports the "Montserrat" font family with three different font weights (300, 400, and 800) from the Google Fonts API. The display=swap parameter ensures that the browser swaps the default font with the "Montserrat" font as soon as it becomes available. */

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

/* *: The asterisk (*) is a universal selector that targets all elements on the page.

margin: 0;: This sets the margin of all elements to zero, effectively removing any default margins that might be applied by the browser.

padding: 0;: This sets the padding of all elements to zero, removing any default padding applied by the browser.

box-sizing: border-box;: This sets the box-sizing property to "border-box" for all elements. The "border-box" box model includes padding and border in the total width and height of an element, making it easier to manage the layout.

scroll-behavior: smooth;: This enables smooth scrolling behavior when users click on anchor links to navigate to different sections of the page.

 */

a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color:red;
}

/* a: This targets all anchor (<a>) elements on the page.

text-decoration: none;: This removes the underline decoration from anchor links, making them appear without underlines.

color: red;: This sets the text color of anchor links to red. So, all anchor links on the page will be displayed in red. */

/* Overall, this CSS code sets up a basic global styling for the web page. It resets margins and paddings, sets the box-sizing property, imports the "Montserrat" font, and customizes the style of anchor links by removing underlines and making them appear in red. */
