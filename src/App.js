// This code represents the main App component of a React application that uses React Router for navigation and Material-UI for styling. Let's break down the code to understand its functionality:

import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";
// import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";: This line imports the necessary dependencies from the React library. It imports React, the Suspense component, and the lazy function. The lazy function is used for lazy loading of components.

import { makeStyles } from "@material-ui/core";
// import { makeStyles } from "@material-ui/core";: This line imports the makeStyles function from the Material-UI library. makeStyles is used to define custom styles for components.

import "./App.css";
// import "./App.css";: This line imports an external CSS file named "App.css". It's likely used to add additional styles to the application.

import { BrowserRouter, Route } from "react-router-dom";
// import { BrowserRouter, Route } from "react-router-dom";: This line imports the BrowserRouter and Route components from the "react-router-dom" library. These components are essential for implementing routing in the application.

import Header from "./components/Header";
// import Header from "./components/Header";: This line imports the Header component from the "./components/Header" file or module.

import Alert from "./components/Alert";
// import Alert from "./components/Alert";: This line imports the Alert component from the "./components/Alert" file or module.

const Homepage = lazy(() => import("./Pages/HomePage"));
// const Homepage = lazy(() => import("./Pages/HomePage"));: This line uses React's lazy function to asynchronously load the Homepage component. The Homepage component is expected to be defined in the "./Pages/HomePage" file or module. The lazy function allows for code splitting, loading the component only when needed.

const CoinPage = lazy(() => import("./Pages/CoinPage"));
// const CoinPage = lazy(() => import("./Pages/CoinPage"));: This line also uses lazy to asynchronously load the CoinPage component from the "./Pages/CoinPage" file or module.


const useStyles = makeStyles(() => ({
  App: {
    backgroundColor: "#14161a",
    color: "white",
    minHeight: "100vh",
  },
}));
// const useStyles = makeStyles(() => ({ ... }));: This defines a custom hook called useStyles that uses the makeStyles function to create styles for the component.

// function App() { ... }: This defines the main functional component named App.

function App() {
  const classes = useStyles();
// const classes = useStyles();: This calls the useStyles hook to get the styles defined for the component and assigns them to the classes variable.

  return (
    // The return statement in the App component returns the JSX representing the main layout of the application.

    <BrowserRouter>
    {/* <BrowserRouter>: This wraps the entire application with the BrowserRouter, enabling routing functionality in the app. */}

      <div className={classes.App}>
        {/* <div className={classes.App}>: This <div> element represents the main container for the application and applies the styles defined in the classes.App to it. */}

        <Header />
        {/* <Header />: This renders the Header component, which is expected to be defined in the "./components/Header" file or module. */}

        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          {/* <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>: The Suspense component wraps the routes and allows for fallback content while the components are being loaded lazily. */}

          <Route path="/" component={Homepage} exact />
          {/* <Route path="/" component={Homepage} exact />: This sets up a route for the homepage, specifying that when the URL path is "/", the Homepage component should be rendered. The exact prop ensures that this route matches exactly when the path is "/". */}

          <Route path="/coins/:id" component={CoinPage} exact />

          {/* <Route path="/coins/:id" component={CoinPage} exact />: This sets up a route for the CoinPage, specifying that when the URL path matches "/coins/:id" (where ":id" is a parameter), the CoinPage component should be rendered. The exact prop ensures an exact match. */}

        </Suspense>
        {/* </Suspense>: Closes the Suspense component. */}
      </div>
      <Alert />
     {/* <Alert />: This renders the Alert component, which is expected to be defined in the "./components/Alert" file or module. */}

    </BrowserRouter>
    // export default App;: This exports the App component so that it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

  );
}

export default App;
// Overall, this code sets up the main structure of a React application with routing using React Router. It lazy loads the homepage and CoinPage components, uses Material-UI for styling, and renders the Header and Alert components. The application's main container has a custom style applied to it to set the background color, text color, and minimum height.
