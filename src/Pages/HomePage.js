// This code is a React functional component that represents a homepage layout. Let's go through the code step by step to understand its functionality:

import React, { Suspense } from "react";
// import React, { Suspense } from "react";: This line imports the necessary dependencies from the React library. It imports the React object and the Suspense component.

import { ErrorBoundary } from "react-error-boundary";
// import { ErrorBoundary } from "react-error-boundary";: This line imports the ErrorBoundary component from the "react-error-boundary" library. The ErrorBoundary component is used to catch and handle errors that might occur within its child components.

import Banner from "../components/Banner/Banner";
// import Banner from "../components/Banner/Banner";: This line imports the Banner component from the "Banner" module located in the "../components/Banner" directory. The relative path may vary depending on the project's file structure.

import ErrorFallback from "../components/ErrorBoundary";
// import ErrorFallback from "../components/ErrorBoundary";: This line imports the ErrorFallback component from the "ErrorBoundary" module located in the "../components" directory. It will be used as a fallback component in case an error occurs within the ErrorBoundary component.


const CoinsTable = React.lazy(() => import("../components/CoinsTable"));
// const CoinsTable = React.lazy(() => import("../components/CoinsTable"));: This line uses React's lazy function to asynchronously load the CoinsTable component. The lazy function is a code-splitting feature that allows you to load components only when they are needed, reducing the initial bundle size.


const Homepage = () => {
  // const Homepage = () => { ... }: This defines a functional component named Homepage.

  return (
    // The return statement in the Homepage component returns the JSX representing the layout of the homepage

    <div>
      <Banner />
      {/* <Banner />: This renders the Banner component. The actual content of the Banner component is not shown here but would be defined in the "Banner" module. */}
      <ErrorBoundary
      // <ErrorBoundary>: This component wraps the Suspense component and any other components that may throw errors. It catches errors and provides a fallback UI through the ErrorFallback component if an error occurs during rendering.

        FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}
        onReset={() => {
        }}
      >

        {/* FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}: This prop sets the ErrorFallback component as the fallback UI in case of an error within the ErrorBoundary.

onReset={() => {}}: This prop specifies a function that will be called when the Reset button (if provided by the ErrorBoundary) is clicked. The function provided here doesn't do anything (() => {}). */}

        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          {/* <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>: The Suspense component is used to wrap the asynchronous loading of the CoinsTable component. It displays a fallback UI (in this case, "Loading...") while the CoinsTable component is being loaded. */}

          <CoinsTable />
        </Suspense>
        {/* <CoinsTable />: This renders the CoinsTable component. Since it is wrapped in a Suspense component, it will be loaded asynchronously and display the fallback UI until it is fully loaded. */}

      </ErrorBoundary>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Homepage;

// export default Homepage;: This exports the Homepage component so that it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

// Overall, this code demonstrates a simple React homepage layout that includes a banner and a dynamically loaded CoinsTable component with error handling using ErrorBoundary and Suspense.
