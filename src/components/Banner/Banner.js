// This is a React component called Banner that implements a banner section with a background image, a tagline, and a carousel using Material-UI components.

// Let's go through the code step-by-step:


import { Container, makeStyles, Typography } from "@material-ui/core";
import Carousel from "./Carousel";

// The component imports various Material-UI components and the custom Carousel component.

const useStyles = makeStyles((theme) => ({
  banner: {
    backgroundImage: "url(./banner2.jpg)",
  },
  bannerContent: {
    height: 400,
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    paddingTop: 25,
    justifyContent: "space-around",
  },
  tagline: {
    display: "flex",
    height: "40%",
    flexDirection: "column",
    justifyContent: "center",
    textAlign: "center",
  },
  carousel: {
    height: "50%",
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
  },
}));

// The makeStyles function from Material-UI is used to create custom styles for the component.

// The component defines styles for the banner section, banner content, tagline, and carousel.


function Banner() {
  const classes = useStyles();

  return (
    <div className={classes.banner}>
      <Container className={classes.bannerContent}>
        <div className={classes.tagline}>
          <Typography
            variant="h2"
            style={{
              fontWeight: "bold",
              marginBottom: 15,
              fontFamily: "Montserrat",
            }}
          >
            Crypto Hunter
          </Typography>
          <Typography
            variant="subtitle2"
            style={{
              color: "darkgrey",
              textTransform: "capitalize",
              fontFamily: "Montserrat",
            }}
          >
            Get all the Info regarding your favorite Crypto Currency
          </Typography>
        </div>
        <Carousel />
      </Container>
    </div>
  );
}

// The Banner component renders a banner section with a background image set using the backgroundImage property in the banner class.

// Inside the banner section, a Container component from Material-UI is used to create a container for the banner content.

// The bannerContent class contains styles for the banner content, including a fixed height of 400 pixels, a flexbox layout with columns, and spacing around the elements.

// The tagline class contains styles for the tagline section of the banner. It is a flexbox layout with columns, centered content, and centered text.

// Inside the tagline section, there are two Typography components. The first one displays the heading "Crypto Hunter" with custom styles for font weight, margin, and font family. The second one displays a subtitle with custom styles for color, text transformation, and font family.

// After the tagline, the Carousel component is rendered. This component likely displays a rotating carousel of content (e.g., images or information) related to the crypto hunter website.

// The Carousel component is not shown in the provided code snippet, so its functionality and implementation details are not visible here.


export default Banner;

// Overall, this Banner component provides a visually appealing banner section with a background image and a tagline for a website related to crypto currencies. It also includes a carousel component that likely adds dynamic content to the banner section. The banner is styled using Material-UI's Container and Typography components, and the custom styles defined in the makeStyles hook.
