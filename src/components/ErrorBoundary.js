// The ErrorFallback is a React component that is typically used with the react-error-boundary library to handle errors that occur within the application. When an error is caught by the error boundary, this component is rendered to display an error message and a "Try again" button to allow the user to attempt to recover from the error.

// Here's a breakdown of the component:

function ErrorFallback({ error, resetErrorBoundary }) {
  return (
    <div role="alert">
      <p>Something went wrong:</p>
      <pre>{error.message}</pre>
      <button onClick={resetErrorBoundary}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  );
}

//The ErrorFallback component receives two props: error and resetErrorBoundary.

// error: The error object that was caught by the error boundary. It contains information about the error, including the error message.

// resetErrorBoundary: A function provided by the error boundary to reset the error state and retry the operation that caused the error.

// Inside the component, a <div> element with role="alert" is used to provide accessibility for screen readers, indicating that this section contains an alert or error message.

// The error message is displayed using a <p> element with the text "Something went wrong:".

// The error message itself is displayed using a <pre> element, which preserves whitespace and line breaks in the error message text, making it easier to read the error details.

// A <button> element with the text "Try again" is provided to allow the user to retry the operation that caused the error. The onClick event is bound to the resetErrorBoundary function, which will trigger the error boundary to reset the error state and attempt to rerender the component where the error occurred.

// This ErrorFallback component is designed to be used as a fallback UI when an error occurs within the application, offering a user-friendly error message and the option to retry the operation. It can be implemented with the react-error-boundary library to wrap specific parts of the application and handle errors gracefully. 

export default ErrorFallback;
